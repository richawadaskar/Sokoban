		<p class="p2">
			<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="s2">Overview: </span></strong><span class="s1">Welcome to the Sokoban version of Aladdin! After the events that occur in the first movie, where Aladdin defeats Jafar with the help of his friends, we all thought Aladdin would not face anymore adversity. Unfortunately, Jafar has escaped the confinements of the lamp, and has taken Aladdin&rsquo;s friends! Help Aladdin rescue each of his friends from the hands and Jafar, and defeat him for once and for all.</span></p>
		<p class="p3">
			<strong><span class="s2">How to play: </span></strong><span class="s1">In order for Aladdin to rescue his friends, he must first push all the boxes in the level to the designated areas marked by a X. However, he can only push one box at a time, so plan carefully where you want to push the boxes. Once you have helped Aladdin to push all the boxes to all the X&rsquo;s on the board, one of his friends will be released. For level one, Aladdin must release his friend the Magic Carpet, and in level 6, Aladdin must rescue Princess Jasmine.</span></p>
